This plugin uses version 2.0 (xml) of the Hoptoad API, and was based on a php notifier by Rich Cavanaugh

The plugin handles exceptions, errors, and fatal errors.
- Fatal Errors will be reported with "Fatal Error: " prepended to the error
- Exceptions will be reported with "Uncaught Exception: " prepended to the error
- Errors will be reported just as they appear 

This has two settings
- hoptoad_disabled: 
	can be set to true to disable the filter. it is recommended that it is disabled for dev / test
- hoptoad_api_key: 
	is the key from hoptoad.
